# Compound AI: Combining Neural Networks and Language Models for Efficient Customer Interactions

In the world of artificial intelligence (AI), combining different types of models to create a more powerful and versatile system is a common practice. This approach, known as compound AI, allows us to leverage the strengths of different AI models to achieve complex tasks. In this blog post, we will discuss how to create a compound AI system that combines a neural network for customer churn prediction and a language model for generating proactive communication.

## The Power of Compound AI

Compound AI is a powerful concept that allows us to create systems that can handle complex tasks that would be difficult for a single model to achieve. In our case, we are combining a neural network, which is excellent at pattern recognition and prediction tasks, with a language model, which excels at generating human-like text.

The neural network is used to predict customer churn based on various customer features. This prediction can provide valuable insights into which customers are most likely to stop doing business with a company. However, simply knowing which customers are likely to churn is not enough. We need to communicate with these customers proactively to address their concerns and improve their experience. This is where the language model comes in.

## Leveraging Language Models for Proactive Communication

Language models are AI models that can generate human-like text. They can be used to generate emails, chat responses, and other forms of communication based on certain inputs. In our case, we use the GPT-4 model from OpenAI to generate an email based on the churn prediction made by our neural network and some other context augmentation.

The language model takes the churn prediction as input, along with additional context such as the company's policies. It then generates an email that addresses the customer's potential concerns, provides information about the company's services, and offers solutions to improve the customer's experience.

Here's a simplified version of the code used to generate the email:

```python
# Make predictions on new data samples
new_data_samples = torch.tensor([
    [3.0, 4.5, 1.0, 5.0, 2.0],
], dtype=torch.float32)

model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    predictions = model(new_data_samples)

# Use the AzureOpenAI API to generate an email based on the churn prediction
ai_message = AzureOpenAI(azure_endpoint=AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT,api_version="2023-07-01-preview",api_key=AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY).chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=[
                {"role":"system", "content":"You are an AI assistant for the Customer Success Org of Acme, Inc."},
                {"role": "user", "content":f"using this context \n{augmented_context}\n\n generate an email to respond to: {Q}"}
                ])
ai_message = ai_message.choices[0].message.content
print(ai_message)
```

In this code, `augmented_context` is a string that contains additional context for the language model, and `Q` is a string that contains the question or prompt for the language model.

## Conclusion

By combining a neural network for customer churn prediction and a language model for proactive communication, we can create a powerful compound AI system that not only predicts customer churn but also generates proactive communication to address customer concerns and improve their experience. This approach showcases the power of compound AI and its potential to transform customer retention strategies.
